          <p class="quote">“TJ was the Lead UI/UX Designer for our game: Marbles on Stream. His responsibilities included redesigning the in-game store, redesigning to improve the overall UI/UX, understanding the stream interactive game experience, and redesigning the company website. TJ was also responsible for communicating his designs to our development team, and ensuring his vision went from initial concepts to implementation. He greatly exceeded my expectations as a UI/UX Designer. He had the patience and ambition to learn the culture of both Twitch and our existing community. He also went above and beyond by learning some of the core features of Unreal Engine 5, allowing him to make better informed design decisions.”</p>

There were countless moving parts, tight timelines, and a lot of pressure to get it right. TJ quickly became the person I leaned on throughout the entire process. He was always stepping in to help, taking ownership without being asked, and bringing fresh, creative ideas that pushed the work to a higher level. In addition to his design skills, he has this drive to find more efficient ways to get things done without ever sacrificing quality. On the toughest days, his positive attitude and sense of humor were an absolute lifesaver. The rebrand was a huge success, and I honestly couldn’t have imagined pulling it off without him.”</p>
